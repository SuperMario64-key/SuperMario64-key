## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on a project aiming to map midi message to keyboard input for macOS using Swift and SwiftUI. The idea is to build something similar to https://github.com/charlieroberts/midiStroke/ but working under newer versions of macOS. Initially, I wanted to use midiStroke and make the necessary changes to make it work on my Mac, but when I first looked at it I quickly felt that it would be easier to rewrite it using Swift & SwiftUI. This led to the creation of this project.
